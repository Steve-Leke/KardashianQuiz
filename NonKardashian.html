  <h2> Not Kardashian </h2>
  <p>
    You just don't have what it takes to be Kardashian. You just don't seem to have the beauty, money, looks,
    manipulation, and talent to be a Kardashian. But don't worry, a lot of people don't have what it takes to be a Kardashian.
    Don't take it personally, because your not special. OKURR!
